# **Hello there, I'm** [rabiafatima.eth](https://twitter.com/rabiaf183) 👋

I am currently a Reserach Engineer at [Xord.com](https://xord.com) learning about various proof systems in ZK such as [PLONK](https://github.com/dusk-network/plonk) and [HALO2](https://github.com/zcash/halo2).
My purpose is to help community achieving the scalability we desire for a global supercomputer.

- 💻 I do reserach in Cryptography(ZK),Ethereum, L2 scaling solutions and abstract protocol concepts.
- ✍️  I write about Blockchain Infrastructure and interoperability.
- 📷I love building in Web3, photography and memes.
